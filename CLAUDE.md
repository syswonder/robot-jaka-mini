Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Git Commits

**Follow the Robonix contribution standard** (https://book.robonix.ai/contributing/robonix).

- Title: Conventional Commits 1.0.0 — `<type>(scope?): <imperative description>`, English imperative mood. Types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `test` `perf` `ci` `build` `chore`. Breaking change: add `!` after type/scope and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` note in the body.
- One commit = one independently reviewable issue. No vague titles ("update", "changes", "fix stuff").
- Body: explain motivation and impact — why the change is needed and what it affects.
- Author/committer must be the responsible human (`Felix <xi.lifeng@qq.com>`). AI agents never appear in author/committer fields and never get responsibility trailers (`Co-authored-by`, `Co-developed-by`, `Signed-off-by`, `Reviewed-by`, `Tested-by`, `Acked-by`).
- Disclose substantive AI assistance with a trailer: `Assisted-by: Claude-Code:glm-5.3` — `agent:model-version`, no email.
- Never commit secrets (`.vlmkey`), keys, build artifacts (`rbnx-build/`, `rbnx-boot/`, `.venv`), or unrelated local changes.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
